# cookieClicker-BOT
Simple bot which plays Cookie Clicker automatically

## General information
This is a simple bot made with Selenium in Python that plays Cookie Cliker in the web browser infinitely. It loads a saved game whenever you execute the program, so make sure that the cookiegame.txt is in the same folder as autocookie.py. In the text file is a game I saved for you to have a test.

## Execution
Once the program is downloaded, make sure you have got all the requirements installed by executing:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After that, run:
```
python autocookie.py
```
Then, a window will be opened and the bot will start playing.
